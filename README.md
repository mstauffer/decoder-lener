# Generative SLMs Meet Brazilian Legal Documents: Efficient NER via LoRA Fine-tuning

This repo holds the code for the BRACIS 2025 paper Generative SLMs Meet Brazilian Legal Documents: Efficient NER via LoRA Fine-tuning. In a nutshell, the project aimed to do Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Small Language Models (SLMs) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. Specifically, we focused on using the Qwen3 SLM family along with the LoRA PEFT technique.

## Features
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for NER tasks
- Named Entity Recognition implementation
- Resource-efficient model training

## Getting Started

For retraining the model used on the paper, use the Jupyter Notebook namely after `training_qwen3-full-8b.ipynb`. The library management is the default for Python:

```
python3 -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For running the evaluation step, please proceed with

```
python3 src/scripts/eval_seqeval3.py <qwen_checkpoint_path> Qwen/Qwen3-8B 0 full
```

The results generated by us are inside the `reports` folder.
